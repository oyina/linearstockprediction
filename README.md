# NVIDIA Stock Prediction with Linear Regression ML - Summer Project

This project focuses on leveraging linear regression and feature engineering to predict NVIDIA (NVDA) stock prices. It begins with a demonstration of same-day prediction, highlighting potential data leakage, and then a better model for next-day price forecasting. Visualizations are generated using Matplotlib. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of notes, findings, and the necessary code blocks for stock price prediction.

## Project Overview

* **Initial Prediction:** Predicts the current day's NVIDIA stock price.
* **Feature Engineering:** Develops relevant features from historical stock data.
* **Next-Day Prediction:** Adjusts the model to predict the next day's NVIDIA stock price, addressing data leakage.
* **Machine Learning:** Utilizes Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
* **Visualization:** Employs Matplotlib for clear representation of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
